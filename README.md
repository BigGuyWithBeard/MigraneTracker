# MigraneTracker

Like many people i get migraines, ad my doctor asked me to fill in a migraine diary.

They gave me a single sheet of paper and left me on my merry way.  I took a look at the diary and thought 'this is rubbish, i can do better'

Im a software developer (on Github? no way!) and i wanted a project to play with. Something small and easy, something that would actually be useful.

So whats wrong with the paper method?
1. limited space
cant fit much text on one tiny line of the paper.
2. limited access
can only fill in the diary if i happen to have the paper with me. Out shopping and get an attack? diary is at home. At work and attack ends? diary is at home.
3. limited scope
the diary was not very good. one line on the diary was to cover the entire day, so cant track the different symptoms throughout the day. 

SO i started on the migrane tracker.  The first version will be quick and nasty - a online version of the paper diary, with minor improvements.
i will get it working with pretty rough code and improve it over time.

I will start with a simple website and evolve it over time to include more and more features, using it as a small showcase eventaully.
I plan to add a mboile app (android only as i dont have an iphone), reporting and exporting, reminders to record a set of readings, and whatever else i find i need (or just find interesting enough).

Although this app is primarily for my own use, feel free to try it Let me know if you find this interesting or even helpful, or have any suggestions.
